<q>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi<br>
 would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise<br>
 he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the<br>
 dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a<br>
 pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he<br>
 was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his<br>
 apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others<br>
 from death, but not himself.
